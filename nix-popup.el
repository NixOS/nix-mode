;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides `guix-define-popup' macro which is just an alias
;; to `magit-define-popup'.  According to the manual:
;;
;;   (info "(magit-popup) Defining prefix and suffix commands")
;;
;; `magit-popup' library will eventually be superseded by a more general
;; library.

;;; Code:

(require 'magit-popup)

(defalias 'guix-define-popup 'magit-define-popup)

(defvar guix-popup-font-lock-keywords
  (eval-when-compile
    `((,(rx "("
            (group "guix-define-popup")
            symbol-end
            (zero-or-more blank)
            (zero-or-one
             (group (one-or-more (or (syntax word) (syntax symbol))))))
       (1 font-lock-keyword-face)
       (2 font-lock-function-name-face nil t)))))

(font-lock-add-keywords 'emacs-lisp-mode guix-popup-font-lock-keywords)

(provide 'guix-popup)
